    <description>
ReSharper Ultimate is a license that combines all individual JetBrains .NET tools, as well as ReSharper C++. Each ReSharper Ultimate license allows a single developer to use ReSharper, ReSharper C++, dotCover, dotTrace and dotMemory.

This package installs all the .NET components of ReSharper Ultimate at once. It is a faster, more efficient alternative to running `choco install resharper dottrace dotmemory dotcover dotpeek` as rather than re-running the JetBrains installer for each application,
it runs it once.

If you want to just install a specific application, then use one or more of the other existing Chocolatey packages:

- [ReSharper](https://chocolatey.org/packages/resharper)
- [dotCover](https://chocolatey.org/packages/dotCover)
- [dotMemory](https://chocolatey.org/packages/dotMemory)
- [dotPeek](https://chocolatey.org/packages/dotPeek)
- [dotTrace](https://chocolatey.org/packages/dotTrace)
